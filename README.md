## <a name="about"></a> About

The purpose of this project is to research Shaders and Computer Graphics by building a Practical Rendering Application that demonstrates their capabilities and use cases. The application allows users to create, manipulate, and experiment with Shaders, showcasing what can be achieved with them and how they function in a Real-Time Rendering Environment.

At its core, this project is a Minimal Rendering Application designed to serve as an experimental environment where Example Scenes can be easily created, Shaders can be tested and iterated on, and various Computer Graphics Techniques can be explored. The primary goal is to provide a Hands-On Learning Experience for understanding Shader Programming and fundamental Computer Graphics Concepts.

Beyond research and learning, the project is built with Extensibility and Modularity in mind, serving as a foundation that can later be developed into a more substantial system, such as a Game Engine or a more comprehensive Graphics Framework.
